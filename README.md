# GymBroRecipes

This project contains a minimal React + Vite setup for a fitness tracker.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build outputs static files to the `dist` folder.

## Netlify Deploy

Netlify will use `netlify.toml` to build and deploy the site. The SPA
redirects are handled via `public/_redirects` so that direct navigation to
routes works correctly.
