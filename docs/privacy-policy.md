# Privacy Policy

GymBroRecipes is built with your privacy in mind. Your workout logs, nutrition data and body metrics are stored locally in your browser by default. We do **not** collect or transmit your personal data unless you choose to upgrade and enable cloud sync.

Upgrading enables secure synchronization via Supabase so you can access your data across devices. This sync is optional, encrypted in transit, and only occurs after you give permission. We don't run ads or thirdâ€‘party trackers and we never sell your information. You remain in full control and can export or delete your data at any time.
